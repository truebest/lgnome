/* Compressed-AU snapshot of one RDP session's video stream, used to re-enter a server's
 * H.264 delta chain without a reconnect. gnome-remote-desktop emits exactly one IDR per
 * connection (no keyframe on suppress resume, Refresh Rect rejected), so once the shared
 * hardware decoder moves to another session, a backgrounded slot's stream becomes
 * undecodable and switching back costs a full on-screen reconnect. Instead the slot is
 * reconnected while it is INVISIBLE (backgrounded): the fresh connection's IDR — plus
 * the few deltas that race the suppress request — is cached here as the raw compressed
 * bytes that came off the wire, and the server is then suppressed. Nothing further is
 * transmitted after the cached AUs, so the server's first delta after resume references
 * exactly the state a replay of this snapshot rebuilds in the decoder.
 *
 * Nothing is decoded or transcoded locally; the snapshot is a byte-for-byte replay
 * source. A decoder-seed AU (SPS + PPS before IDR) restarts the snapshot, deltas before
 * the first seed are ignored, and malformed input or overflow — e.g. a server that
 * keeps streaming despite suppress — voids the whole snapshot, because a partial delta
 * chain is undecodable.
 *
 * Thread model: the caller serializes all access (in the native app: app->video_lock).
