/* System (TV) master volume over the webOS Luna bus, for the mixer overlay's MASTER
 * fader. This deliberately does NOT touch the app's own audio mix: the fader mirrors
 * and drives the platform volume — the same one the remote's VOL keys, Bluetooth
 * headphone buttons and a keyboard's Fn-volume keys adjust — which webOS handles above
 * the app (none of those keys ever reach us; verified live).
 *
 * Transport: the NATIVE luna-service2 client library on a dedicated GMainLoop thread.
 * NEVER a luna-send-pub subprocess: fork()ing this process while the NDL/OMX video
 * pipeline is (re)loading raced its in-process decoder state and produced black
 * screens (child inherits driver/SVP handles), and a pipe-spawned subscriber cannot
 * deliver events anyway (block-buffered stdout, no stdbuf on the TV). In-process LS2
 * calls carry no fork. Volume-change SUBSCRIPTIONS do not exist for a dev-mode app on
 * this platform — every endpoint was probed live and refused or went dark (the exact dead
 * ends are documented in luna_volume.c) — so callers keep the cache live by polling
 * getVolume: the one-shots are cheap and each call wakes the dozing dynamic service.
 *
 * The audio methods used (absolute get/setVolume on luna://com.webos.audio) are
 * undocumented-but-working from the app's jail (verified live; LG documents only
 * volumeUp/Down/setMuted for third parties). If a firmware ever rejects them, the
 * module just stays unavailable and the MASTER fader dims — nothing else breaks.
 *
 * set() coalesces with at most ONE call in flight: the newest requested value is sent
 * when the bus is idle, otherwise it chains from the in-flight call's reply — a fader
 * drag can never queue a backlog of setVolume calls. The cache updates optimistically
 * on set() (snappy knob) and authoritatively from getVolume replies ONLY: a set
 * confirmation echoes an older value whenever sets chain, and writing it back would
 * visibly yank the knob backward mid-drag. */
