# Third-party dependency provenance

This file records native webOS dependencies that are pinned for the native-only
`lgnome` target. The historical browser app, JavaScript service, browser harnesses,
and browser WASM bundle were removed and are not runtime dependencies of the native package.

## backend_ndl (first-party submodule)

- Path: `third_party/backend_ndl` (git submodule)
- Development remote: `git@bitbucket.org:kodavr/backend_ndl.git` (private)
- Public mirror: https://github.com/truebest/backend_ndl — an append-only chain of release
  snapshots. Released `.gitmodules` points here, so a published tag resolves without
  access to the development remote; the two carry the same tree at every release.
- Version: 0.5.0
- Pinned commit: `3d8658833eccba3407537311147d187b5606d321`
- License: MIT; see `third_party/backend_ndl/LICENSE`
- Native usage: runtime-loaded NDL DirectMedia facade wrapper for hardware video and mixed
  PCM audio. Firmware NDL binaries and SDK headers are not redistributed.

## IronRDP

- Path: `third_party/IronRDP` (git submodule — lgnome fork)
- Fork: https://github.com/truebest/IronRDP.
- Branch: `release/lgnome-0.5.4`.
- Pinned commit: `3bec84e1ee1d5721905580e381e0b6fc1d0f5d98`
- Upstream: https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP
- Upstream base: `1bec1d57f446a7ddef8f26b0c3c644059564cdc2` (2026-09-06).
- Base commit and fork delta provenance: see `third_party/IronRDP/PROVENANCE.md`.
- License: MIT OR Apache-2.0; see `third_party/IronRDP/LICENSE-MIT` and
  `third_party/IronRDP/LICENSE-APACHE`
- Native usage: RDP connector/session/EGFX protocol, AVC420 passthrough hooks, and
  RemoteFX Progressive decode to RGBA bitmap updates for the native renderer.

## LVGL

- Path: `third_party/lvgl` (git submodule)
- Upstream: https://github.com/mariotaku/lvgl.git
- Pinned commit: `185ea1fc61dd01fac61867d2d6b56892e80c6058`
- License: MIT; see `third_party/lvgl/LICENCE.txt`
- Native usage: SDL-rendered pre-connect GUI for host/port entry before native RDP startup.

## libevdev

- Source: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/libevdev/libevdev-1.13.6.tar.xz
- Version: 1.13.6
- SHA-256: `73f215eccbd8233f414737ac06bca2687e67c44b97d2d7576091aa9718551110`
- License: MIT, with the bundled Linux input header GPL-2.0 notice recorded in
  `third_party/libevdev-COPYING`
- Native usage: statically linked into webOS builds for grabbed USB mouse/keyboard evdev input.

## miniaudio

- Path: `third_party/miniaudio` (git submodule)
- Upstream: https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio
- Version/tag: `0.11.25`
- Pinned commit: `9634bedb5b5a2ca38c1ee7108a9358a4e233f14d`
- License choice: MIT No Attribution (upstream Alternative 2); see
  `third_party/miniaudio/LICENSE`
- Native usage: headless 48 kHz float engine with one `ma_sound` voice per RDP session,
  per-session S16 conversion and dynamic resampling. Device I/O, file decoding/encoding,
  the resource manager, generators, runtime backend loading, and miniaudio threading
  primitives are disabled at compile time; the engine is wired once before rendering
  and NDL is the selected production audio sink.

## Moonlight reference boundary

[Moonlight TV](https://github.com/mariotaku/moonlight-tv) (GPL-3.0) was used as a
read-only reference for webOS toolchain conventions, dependency revisions, and general
GUI behavior on TV. No Moonlight TV
application code has been copied or adapted into this repository, and none may be:
lgnome's own code is MIT-licensed, which is incompatible with incorporating GPL
application code. Only the dependency pins above (which carry their own licenses) are
shared with it.
